The Hunter is arguably the strongest choice for reaching 60 without dying. Their toolkit provides them with benefits that outmatch nearly all other classes in leveling which has given them a reputation for being the kings of leveling. With ranged + melee attacks, a pet to tank enemies, high movement speed, and a combat drop, hunters can handle most any situation.
